Data Science for Product Managers

Fall 2017 Mini-course 2 (6 units)

Course Summary

Product managers engage in a variety of complex activities critical to product success including
0 Product requirements gathering
Forecasting customer demand
Customer segmentation
Pricing
Allocating marketing spend
Identifying buying patterns
0 Analyzing and responding to customer feedback
Historically decisions in these areas have often relied on intuition and guesswork, leading to
misjudgment of the market and other key factors, and ultimately, product failures. Developments
in data science, combining the increasing availability of data from internal and external sources
with new algorithms that exploit that data at scale, offer new possibilities for putting product
management decisions on a more quantitative and rigorous footing. Students in this course will
be introduced to a variety of data science techniques applicable to activities to which product
managers typically contribute. These techniques include preference modeling, time series
forecasting, regression, clustering, classification, A/B testing, and analytics for unstructured data
including clickstreams, text, speech, and images. Along the way, students will learn about
practical aspects of applying data science to product management, including:
0 Choosing appropriate metrics for product success
Selecting and assessing data sources
Instrumenting products for data collection
Data science infrastructure choices
Evaluating data science models
Documenting and communicating data science results
Planning and delivering data science projects
Data science pitfalls to watch for

This course is primarily aimed at students with technical backgrounds who wish to apply their
skills to product management. Backgrounds in basic statistics, and some programming
experience are required, as the course will includes hands-on exercises in Python to illustrate
the concepts. In-class exercises and weekly assignments will mainly focus on interpretation of
the output of various data science techniques and matching different techniques to product
